**ML PLAYGROUND**

This is a lightweight repository for my machine learning experiments, study notes, and mini projects.
In this repo, I:
- attempt to implement classic ML algorithms from scratch
- experiment with PyTorch and Scikit-learn pieplines
- keep study notes on math, stats, and DSA for ML
- keep a portfolio of Kaggle-style mini projects

**CONTENT:**
- datasets/: sample datasets used in my notebooks.
- resources/: cheat sheets, reference links, paper summaries and textbooks.
- projects/: a collection of my projects and algorithm implementations
