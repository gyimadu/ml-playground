**ml playground**

lightweight repository for my machine learning experiments, study notes, and mini-projects.
in this repo, I:
- implement classic algorithms from scratch
- experiemnt with pytorch and scikit-learn pipekines
- keep study notes on math, stats, and dsa for ml
- keep a portfolio of kaggle-style miini-projects
  

**contents:**
- datasets/: small sample data used in some notebooks.
- resources/: cheat sheets, reference links, paper summaries and textbooks.
- projects/: a portfolio of kaggle-style mini-projects
